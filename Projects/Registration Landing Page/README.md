# 🎓 Student Landing Page

Welcome to the **Student Landing Page** project! This was the first landing page I created during my internship. Its primary purpose is to facilitate student registrations and can be effectively linked to social media ads to capture leads.

## ✨ Features

- **📱 Responsive Design**: Built with Bootstrap 5, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices.
- **📈 Lead Capture**: Designed to integrate with social media campaigns for efficient lead generation.
- **⚠️ Error Handling**: Robust error handling to ensure a smooth user experience.
- **📧 Email Notifications**: Integrated with EmailJS to send notifications to the admin with lead details whenever a student books a class.
